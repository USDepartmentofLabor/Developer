title: Safety and Transparency - Through Data
---
You have the right to a safe workplace – and so do the employees at your favorite café, the local hospital and the
construction company renovating homes in your neighborhood.
 
But how can you tell if the businesses you patronize are keeping its workers safe? Developers and others can check
out the Labor Department’s Application Programming Interface for its [online enforcement database](/health-and-safety/dol-osha-enforcement/),
included in the recent launch of [DOL’s next-generation API](http://usdepartmentoflabor.github.io/Quarry/).
In these datasets, you can find enforcement data collected by the [Occupational Safety and Health Administration](http://osha.gov).
 
##The Data

The OSHA datasets include details on the roughly 90,000 OSHA inspections conducted every year, and covers more than
four decades. If you want to know what businesses in your area have been inspected, whether violations were found,
and what citations and fines were issued, it’s all there. You can also find details on injuries and fatalities leading
to accident inspections.
 
These data are handy for journalists and academic researchers, but it also has practical implications for citizens who
want to ensure that they’re supporting businesses with a proven commitment to labor rights. And employers can use it to
identify common citations in similar workplaces, so they can correct any potential issues before they cause problems on
the job. With DOL’s new API, apps can easily be created around the data.  

##The API

The new API that is being released to support these new datasets represents the next stage in DOL’s open data efforts.
This new system will expand opportunities for everyone using our data. In the coming months, we’ll be rolling out
frequent and regular enhancements. This product, which we’re naming “[Quarry](http://usdepartmentoflabor.github.io/Quarry/),”
is being released as an open source
project, which will enable other agencies to deploy a free, secure and supported solution to roll out a centralized API,
a “one stop shop” for the agency’s data.

It’s government transparency at its best.
 
And that’s not all you’ll find in the API. It will soon carry data from the department’s other enforcement agencies:
the [Employee Benefits Security Administration](http://dol.gov/ebsa),
[Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs](http://dol.gov/ofccp),
[Mine Safety and Health Administration](http://msha.gov), and [Wage and Hour Division](http://dol.gov/whd).
